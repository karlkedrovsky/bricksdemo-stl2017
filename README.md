# Demo Site For Bricks Talk At Drupal Camp St Louis 2017

This is a simple Dupal 8 site used to demo site building using Bricks and ECK. It uses [Docksal](https://docksal.io/) but that isn't required.

## Setup

If you're using Docksal just run the following commands starting in the root directory.

```
fin start
fin exec composer install
```

## Database and Files Content

The backup directory contains a database dump and and archive of the sites/default/files directory you can use to get a site very similar to (or the same as) the site at the end of the demo.
